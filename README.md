## CREDITS

As a user of both Lightroom Classic and Piwigo, the ability use the powerful Publishing Service in LrC to keep my Piwigo galleries up to date is very appealing. I've been a long time user of a popular plugin that has been providing this functionality, but unfortunately since the version 15 release of LrC that has not been available. 

This plugin was developed to allow me to continue publishing to Piwigo from LrC, and I have looked at the work of others for help and ideas in developing this plugin. In particular, the following should be credited:
